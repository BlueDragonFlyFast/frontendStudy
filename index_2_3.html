                    <p>
                        "Will the day come where there are no more secondhand
                        bookshops?” the poet, essayist, and bookseller Marius
                        Kociejowski asks in his new memoir, “A Factotum in the Book
                        Trade.” He suspects that such a day will not arrive, but,
                        troublingly, he is unsure. In London, his adopted hometown
                        and a great hub of the antiquarian book trade, many of
                        Kociejowski’s haunts—including his former employer, the
                        famed Bertram Rota shop, a pioneer in the trade of first
                        editions of modern books and “one of the last of the old
                        establishments, dynastic and oxygenless, with a hierarchy that
                        could be more or less described as Victorian”—have already
                        fallen prey to rising rents and shifting winds. Kociejowski
                        dislikes the fancy, well-appointed bookstores that have
                        sometimes taken their place. “I want chaos; I want, above all,
                        mystery,” he writes. The best bookstores, precisely
                        because of the dustiness of their back shelves and even the
                        crankiness of their guardians, promise that “somewhere, in one
                        of their nooks and crannies, there awaits a book that will
                        ever so subtly alter one’s existence.” With every shop that
                        closes, a bit of that life-altering power is lost and the
                        world leaches out “more of the serendipity which feeds the
                        human spirit.”

                    <h3>Subsection</h3>

                    <p>
                        Kociejowski writes from the “ticklish underbelly” of the
                        book trade as a “factotum” rather than a book dealer, since
                        he was always too busy with writing to ever run a store.
                        His memoir is a representative slice, a core sample, of
                        the rich and partly vanished world of bookselling in England
                        from the late nineteen-seventies to the present. As Larry
                        McMurtry puts it, in his own excellent (and informative)
                        memoir of life as a bookseller, “Books,” “the antiquarian
                        book trade is an anecdotal culture,” rich with lore of the
                        great and eccentric sellers and collectors who animate the
                        trade. Kociejowski writes how “the multifariousness of human
                        nature is more on show” in a bookstore than in any other
                        place, adding, “I think it’s because of books, what they are,
                        what they release in ourselves, and what they become when we
                        make them magnets to our desires.”

                        The bookseller’s memoir is, in part, a record of accomplishments,
                        of deals done, rarities uncovered—or, in the case of the
                        long-suffering Shaun Bythell, the owner of the largest secondhand
                        bookstore in Scotland, the humdrum frustrations and occasional
                        pleasures of running a big bookshop. While Kociejowski recounts
                        some high points of his bookselling career (such as
                        cataloguing James Joyce’s personal library or briefly working at
                        the fusty but venerable Maggs Bros., the antiquarian booksellers
                        to the Queen), he above all remembers the characters he came to
                        know. “I firmly believe the fact of being surrounded by books has
                        a great deal to do with flushing to the surface the inner lives of
                        people,” he writes.

                    <p>
                        Is the nonprofit model the future for good bookstores in America?
                        The most concretely interesting question Deutsch raises is also
                        the one about which he is most reticent: we hear nothing about
                        how this experiment has gone, and whether it may be reproducible
                        elsewhere. Deutsch’s book is a bit too high-minded to linger much
                        on the actual business of book selling, preferring instead to quote
                        Talmudic scholarship, Montaigne, Emerson, or Elizabeth Hardwick,
                        among a shop full of others, on books and reading. But Deutsch’s
                        praise of bookstores is incomplete without a consideration of
                        their commercial worldliness, halfway between the leisurely
                        culture of ideas and the realities of business. The bookseller
                        sometimes has more credibility than the professor precisely because
                        she knows what people actually want to buy—and what books are
                        worth buying. That, too, is a social good worth protecting
